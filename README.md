# Bitonic Sort: CPU vs CUDA

This project implements Bitonic Sort in both sequential C and CUDA to compare performance on different input sizes.

## Features
- Sequential Bitonic Sort (C)
- Parallel Bitonic Sort (CUDA)
- Performance measurements and speedup analysis

## How to run
Compile and run the CPU and CUDA versions separately, then compare results.

## Results
CUDA shows significant speedup for medium and large inputs, while CPU performs better on small inputs.
